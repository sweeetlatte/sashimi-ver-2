                Purchase 4 oz (110 g) each of sushi grade salmon, tuna, and
                yellowtail. The fish you use to make sashimi needs to be
                incredibly fresh. Go to a fish market and purchase sushi grade
                salmon, tuna, or yellowtail. Do not buy fish that is not
                considered safe to eat raw!
            </div>
            <div className="instruction-content">
                If there is no fish market in your area, try visiting an Asian
                market that has a seafood counter or ask the employees at your
                grocery storeâ€™s fish counter if they have any sushi grade fish
                available. Keep in mind that this usually just means the fish
                was previously frozen to kill any parasites.
                <br />
                Tell the fish monger or fish counter employee that you are
                making sashimi and ask them to cut it into a sashimi block so
                that you only have to purchase what you need

                    Choose fresh vegetables to pair with sashimi. Sashimi is
                    often served with a selection of fresh raw vegetables to
                    complement the flavors of the fresh fish. Pick up a few
                    fresh, whole veggies at the market when you purchase the
                    fish. Some good options include:
                    <br /> Daikon radish
                    <br /> Cucumber
                    <br /> Carrots
                    <br /> Avocado
                    <br /> Shiso leaves
